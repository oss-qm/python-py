consider conftest hooks only for items below the dir
---------------------------------------------------------
tags: bug

currently conftest hooks remain registered throughout 
the whole testing process.  Consider to only have them
called if their filesystem location is below a test item.


introduce py.test.mark.ignoretest 
-------------------------------------------------------
tags: feature

for not considering a function for test collection at all. 
maybe also introduce a py.test.mark.test to explicitely
mark a function to become a tested one.  Lookup 
Java JUnit recent strategies/syntax.
