pytest_nose plugin
==================

nose-compatibility plugin: allow to run nose test suites natively.

.. contents::
  :local:

This is an experimental plugin for allowing to run tests written 
in the 'nosetests' style with py.test.  
nosetests is a popular clone 
of py.test and thus shares some philosophy.  This plugin is an 
attempt to understand and neutralize differences.  It allows to 
run nosetests' own test suite and a number of other test suites 
without problems. 

Usage
-------------

If you type::

    py.test -p nose 

where you would type ``nosetests``, you can run your nose style tests.  
You might also try to run without the nose plugin to see where your test
suite is incompatible to the default py.test. 

To avoid the need for specifying a command line option you can set an environment 
variable::

    PYTEST_PLUGINS=nose  

or create a ``conftest.py`` file in your test directory or below::

    # conftest.py 
    pytest_plugins = "nose", 

If you find issues or have suggestions you may run:: 

    py.test -p nose --pastebin=all 

to create a URL of a test run session and send it with comments to the issue
tracker or mailing list. 

Known issues 
------------------

- nose-style doctests are not collected and executed correctly,
  also fixtures don't work.

Do you find the above documentation or the plugin itself lacking? 

1. Download `pytest_nose.py`_ plugin source code 
2. put it somewhere as ``pytest_nose.py`` into your import path 
3. a subsequent ``py.test`` run will use your local version
