pytest_xfail plugin
===================

mark python test functions as expected-to-fail and report them separately.

.. contents::
  :local:

usage
------------

Use the generic mark decorator to mark your test functions as 
'expected to fail':: 

    @py.test.mark.xfail
    def test_hello():
        ...

This test will be executed but no traceback will be reported 
when it fails. Instead terminal reporting will list it in the 
"expected to fail" section or "unexpectedly passing" section.

Do you find the above documentation or the plugin itself lacking? 

1. Download `pytest_xfail.py`_ plugin source code 
2. put it somewhere as ``pytest_xfail.py`` into your import path 
3. a subsequent ``py.test`` run will use your local version
