pytest_skipping plugin
======================

mark python test functions, classes or modules for conditional

.. contents::
  :local:

skipping (skipif) or as expected-to-fail (xfail).  Both declarations
lead to special reporting and both can be systematically associated
with functions, whole classes or modules. The difference between
the two is that 'xfail' will still execute test functions
but it will revert the outcome.  A passing test is now
a failure and failing test is expected.  All skip conditions
are reported at the end of test run through the terminal
reporter.

.. _skipif:

skip a test function conditionally
-------------------------------------------

Here is an example for skipping a test function on Python3::

    @py.test.mark.skipif("sys.version_info >= (3,0)")
    def test_function():
        ...

Conditions are specified as python expressions
and can access the ``sys`` module.  They can also
access the config object and thus depend on command
line or conftest options::

    @py.test.mark.skipif("config.getvalue('db') is None")
    def test_function(...):
        ...

conditionally mark a function as "expected to fail"
-------------------------------------------------------

You can use the ``xfail`` keyword to mark your test functions as
'expected to fail'::

    @py.test.mark.xfail
    def test_hello():
        ...

This test will be executed but no traceback will be reported
when it fails. Instead terminal reporting will list it in the
"expected to fail" or "unexpectedly passing" sections.
As with skipif_ you may selectively expect a failure
depending on platform::

    @py.test.mark.xfail("sys.version_info >= (3,0)")
    def test_function():
        ...

skip/xfail a whole test class or module
-------------------------------------------

Instead of marking single functions you can skip
a whole class of tests when runnign on a specific
platform::

    class TestSomething:
        skipif = "sys.platform == 'win32'"

Or you can mark all test functions as expected
to fail for a specific test configuration::

    xfail = "config.getvalue('db') == 'mysql'"


skip if a dependency cannot be imported
---------------------------------------------

You can use a helper to skip on a failing import::

    docutils = py.test.importorskip("docutils")

You can use this helper at module level or within
a test or setup function.

You can aslo skip if a library does not have the right version::

    docutils = py.test.importorskip("docutils", minversion="0.3")

The version will be read from the specified module's ``__version__`` attribute.


dynamically skip from within a test or setup
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to skip the execution of a test you can call
``py.test.skip()`` within a test, a setup or from a
`funcarg factory`_ function.  Example::

    def test_function():
        if not valid_config():
            py.test.skip("unsuppored configuration")

.. _`funcarg factory`: ../funcargs.html#factory

1. Download `pytest_skipping.py`_ plugin source code 
2. put it somewhere as ``pytest_skipping.py`` into your import path 
3. a subsequent ``py.test`` run will use your local version
