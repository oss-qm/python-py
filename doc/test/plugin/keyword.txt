Marking functions and setting rich attributes
----------------------------------------------------

By default, all filename parts and class/function names of a test
function are put into the set of keywords for a given test.  You can
specify additional kewords like this::

    @py.test.mark.webtest
    def test_send_http():
        ... 

This will set an attribute 'webtest' to True on the given test function.
You can read the value 'webtest' from the functions __dict__ later.

You can also set values for an attribute which are put on an empty
dummy object::

    @py.test.mark.webtest(firefox=30)
    def test_receive():
        ...

after which ``test_receive.webtest.firefox == 30`` holds true. 

In addition to keyword arguments you can also use positional arguments::

    @py.test.mark.webtest("triangular")
    def test_receive():
        ...

after which ``test_receive.webtest._1 == 'triangular`` hold true.
