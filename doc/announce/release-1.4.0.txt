pylib 1.4.0: cross-platform library for path, code, io, ... manipulations
===========================================================================

"py" is a small library comprising APIs for filesystem and svn path manipulations,
dynamic code construction and introspection, IO capturing and a Python2/Python3
compatibility namespace.  It runs unmodified on all Python interpreters compatible
to Python2.4 up until Python 3.2.

The py distribution prior to 1.4.0 used to contain "py.test" which now
comes as its own "pytest" distribution.  Also, the "py.cleanup|py.lookup|py.countloc"
etc. helpers are now part of pycmd.  This makes "py-1.4.0" a simple library
not installing any command line utilities.  The general idea for "py" is to
place high value on providing some basic APIs that are continously tested
against many Python interpreters and thus also to help transition.
