py.test / py lib 1.0.0: new test plugins, funcargs and cleanups 
============================================================================

Welcome to the 1.0 release bringing new flexibility and 
power to testing with Python.  Main news: 

* funcargs - new flexibilty and zero-boilerplate fixtures for Python testing: 

  - separate test code, configuration and setup 
  - ideal for integration and functional tests
  - more powerful dynamic generation of tests

* new plugin architecture, allowing project-specific and 
  cross-project single-file plugins.  Many useful examples
  shipped by default:

  * pytest_unittest.py: run and integrate traditional unittest.py tests 
  * pytest_xfail.py: mark tests as "expected to fail" and report separately.
  * pytest_pocoo.py: automatically send tracebacks to pocoo paste service 
  * pytest_monkeypatch.py: safely monkeypatch from tests
  * pytest_figleaf.py: generate html coverage reports 
  * pytest_resultlog.py: generate buildbot-friendly reporting output 

  and many more!

* distributed testing and distributed execution (py.execnet): 

  - new unified "TX" URL scheme for specifying remote resources 
  - new sync/async ways to handle multiple remote processes 
  - improved documentation 

See the py.test and py lib documentation for more info: 

    http://pytest.org
    http://pylib.org

The py lib now is smaller and focuses more on offering 
functionality used by the py.test tool in independent 
namespaces: 

* py.execnet: elastic code deployment to SSH, Socket and local sub processes
* py.code: higher-level introspection and dynamic generation of python code 
* py.path: path abstractions over local and subversion files 

Some non-strictly-test related code, notably greenlets/co-routines 
and apigen now live on their own and have been removed, also simplifying
the installation procedures. 

The whole package works well with Linux, OSX and Win32, on 
Python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6.  (Expect Python3 compatibility soon!) 

best,
