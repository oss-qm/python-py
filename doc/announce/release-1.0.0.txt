py.test / py lib 1.0.0: new test plugins, funcargs and cleanups 
============================================================================

Welcome to the 1.0 release bringing new flexibility and 
power to testing with Python!  Main news: 

* improved architecture, featuring simple single-file plugins, e.g:

  pytest_unittest.py: run traditional unittest.py tests 
  pytest_xfail.py: mark tests as "expected to fail" 
  pytest_pocoo.py: automatically send tracebacks to pocoo paste service 
  pytest_monkeypatch.py: safely patch parts of your environment in a test function
  pytest_figleaf.py: generate html coverage reports 
  pytest_resultlog.py: generate buildbot-friendly output 

  and many more! 

* funcargs - powerful mechanism for all your setup needs 

* distributed testing: ad-hoc send and run tests on many platforms 

* remove first round of non-test related code, notably 
  greenlets and apigen (documentation generation) that 
  now live on their own 

See the py.test documentation for more info: 

    http://pytest.org

The py lib also got smaller and focuses on offering much of the 
well-tested py.test code in independent namespaces: 

* py.execnet: ad-hoc code distribution to SSH, Socket and local sub processes
* py.code: higher-level introspection and dynamic generation of python code 
* py.path: path abstractions over local and subversion files 

The whole package works well with Linux, OSX and Win32, on 
Python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6.  (Expect Python3 compatibility soon!)
