py.test / py lib 1.0.0: new test plugins, funcargs and cleanups 
============================================================================

Welcome to the 1.0 release bringing new flexibility and 
power to testing with Python.  Main news: 

* improved test architecture, featuring super-simple project 
  specific or cross-project single-file plugins, e.g:

  * pytest_unittest.py: run traditional unittest.py tests 
  * pytest_xfail.py: mark tests as "expected to fail" 
  * pytest_pocoo.py: automatically send tracebacks to pocoo paste service 
  * pytest_monkeypatch.py: safely patch parts of your environment in a test function
  * pytest_figleaf.py: generate html coverage reports 
  * pytest_resultlog.py: generate buildbot-friendly output 

  and many more!

* funcargs - bringing new flexibilty and zero-boilerplate to Python testing: 

  - cleanly separated test code and test configuration and test value setup 
  - ideal for integration and functional tests
  - new generative tests -> deprecation of yield-generated tests

* distributed testing and distributed execution (py.execnet): 

  - new unified "TX" URL scheme for specifying remote resources 
  - new sync/async ways to handle multiple remote processes 
  - much improved documentation 


See the py.test documentation for more info: 

    http://pytest.org

The py lib also got smaller and focuses on offering much of the 
well-tested py.test code in independent namespaces: 

* py.execnet: ad-hoc code distribution to SSH, Socket and local sub processes
* py.code: higher-level introspection and dynamic generation of python code 
* py.path: path abstractions over local and subversion files 

Some non-strictly-test related code, notably greenlets/co-routines 
and apigen now live on their own and have been removed, also simplifying
the installation procedures. 

The whole package works well with Linux, OSX and Win32, on 
Python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6.  (Expect Python3 compatibility soon!)
