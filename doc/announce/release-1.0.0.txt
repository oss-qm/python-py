py.test / py lib 1.0.0: distributed testing and dynamic code deployment 
============================================================================

Welcome to the 1.0 release bringing new flexibility and 
power to testing with Python!  Main news: 

* new py.test plugin architecture, some examples: 

  pytest_xfail.py: mark tests as "expected to fail" 
  pytest_pocoo.py: automatically send tracebacks to pocoo paste service 
  pytest_monkeypatch.py: safely patch parts of your environment in a test function
  pytest_figleaf.py: generate html coverage reports 
  pytest_resultlog.py: generate buildbot-friendly output 

  and much more! 

* funcargs - the new flexible mechanism for managing all your test setup/fixture needs! 

* flexibly distribute tests to multiple computers from the command line

See the py.test documentation for more info: 

    http://pytest.org

The py lib contains the py.test tool and offers its well-tested code 
independently from the testing tool, mainly:

* py.execnet: ad-hoc code distribution to SSH, Socket and local sub processes
* py.code: support for dynamically running and debugging python code 
* py.path: path abstractions over local and subversion files 

The whole package works well with Linux, OSX and Win32, on 
Python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6.  (Expect Python3 compatibility soon!)
