pylib 2.0.0: cross-platform library for path, code, io, ... manipulations
===========================================================================

"pylib" is a library comprising APIs for filesystem and svn path manipulations,
dynamic code construction, IO capturing and a Python2/Python3 compatibility
namespace.  It runs unmodified on all Python interpreters compatible to
Python2.4 up until Python 3.2.  "pylib" functionality used to be contained in a
PyPI distribution named "py" and then contained "py.test" and other
command line tools.  This is now history.  "pytest" is its own distribution
and "pylib" can be and is used completely separately from py.test.
The other "py.*" command line tools are installed with the new
separate "pycmd" distribution.

The general idea for "pylib" is to place high value on providing
some basic APIs that are continously tested against many Python
interpreters and thus also to help transition.
