py.test/pylib 1.2.2: bugfixes and per-plugin hooks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

py.test-1.2.2 is a minor release with brings a number of 
bug fixes and improved compatibility with Python3 and Jython-2.5.1 on Windows.  
It also is the first release that allows plugins to dynamically register 
new hooks (which might be implemented by yet other plugins) allowing plugins to 
interoperate without requiring a new core release. 

py.test is an advanced automated testing tool working with
Python2, Python3 and Jython versions on all major operating
systems.  It has a simple plugin architecture and can run many 
existing common Python test suites without modification.  It offers 
some unique features not found in other testing tools.  
See http://pytest.org for more info.

For more detailed information see the changelog below. 

cheers and have fun,
