Changes 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 
------------------------

* added a 'pytest_nose' plugin which handles nose.SkipTest, 
  nose-style function/method/generator setup/teardown and 
  tries to report functions correctly.  

* much improved documentation layout: see http://pytest.org 

* unicode fixes: capturing and unicode writes to sys.stdout 
  (through e.g a print statement) now work within tests, 
  they are encoded as "utf8" by default, also terminalwriting 
  was adapted and somewhat unified between windows and linux 

* fix issue #27: better reporting on non-collectable items given on commandline 
  (e.g. pyc files)

* fix issue #33: added --version flag (thanks Benjamin Peterson) 

* fix issue #32: adding support for "incomplete" paths to wcpath.status()

* "Test" prefixed classes are *not* collected by default anymore if they 
  have an __init__ method 

* monkeypatch setenv() now accepts a "prepend" parameter

* improved reporting of collection error tracebacks

* simplified multicall mechanism and plugin architecture, 
  renamed some internal methods and argnames
