py.test/pylib 1.1.1: bugfix release, improved 1.0.x backward compat
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a compatibility fixing release of pylib/py.test to work
better with previous 1.0.x code bases.  It also contains fixes
and changes to work with `execnet>=1.0.0b4`_ which is now required
(but is not installed automatically, issue "easy_install -U execnet").
Last but not least, documentation has been improved.

What is pylib/py.test? 
-----------------------

py.test is an advanced automated testing tool working with
Python2, Python3 and Jython versions on all major operating
systems. It has an extensive plugin architecture and can run many 
existing common Python test suites without modification.  Moreover,
it offers some unique features not found in other
testing tools.  See http://pytest.org for more info.

The pylib contains a localpath and svnpath implementation 
and some developer-oriented command line tools. See
http://pylib.org for more info.

thanks to all who helped and gave feedback,
have fun,

.. _`execnet>=1.0.0b4`: http://codespeak.net/execnet

Changes between 1.1.1 and 1.1.0
=====================================

- fix py.test dist-testing to work with execnet >= 1.0.0b4 (required)

- re-introduce py.test.cmdline.main() for better backward compatibility 

- svn paths: fix a bug with path.check(versioned=True) for svn paths,
  allow '%' in svn paths, make svnwc.update() default to interactive mode 
  like in 1.0.x and add svnwc.update(interactive=False) to inhibit interaction.

- try harder to have deprecation warnings for py.compat.* accesses
  report a correct location
