fix --looponfailing: currently in case of failures
all tests are re-run.  the problem was introduced 
while cleaning up session.main() calls ... 
the setup of remote and local config objects
and collectors needs to be reviewed anyway
(and the terminalsession and rsession handling
of such config object should be unified with
respect to this configuration/failure communication)
