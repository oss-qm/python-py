py lib 0.9.0: py.test, distributed execution and dev support 
======================================================================

Welcome to the 0.9.0 py lib (including py.test) release!  
Main API/Tool Features: 

* py.test: cross-project testing tool with many advanced features
* py.execnet: ad-hoc code distribution to SSH, Socket and local sub processes
* py.magic.greenlet: micro-threads on standard CPython ("stackless-light")
* py.path: path abstractions over local and subversion files 
* rich documentation of py's exported API 
* tested against Win32, Linux and OSX 

All these features and their API have extensive documentation,
generated with "apigen", which we intend to make accessible
for other python projects as well.  

Here is the entry point for installing the py lib:
