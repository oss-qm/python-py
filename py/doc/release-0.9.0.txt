py lib 0.9.0: py.test, distributed execution, greenlets and more
======================================================================

Welcome to the 0.9.0 py lib release - a library aiming to 
support agile and test-driven python development on various levels. 

Main API/Tool Features: 

* py.test: cross-project testing tool with many advanced features
* py.execnet: ad-hoc code distribution to SSH, Socket and local sub processes
* py.magic.greenlet: micro-threads on standard CPython ("stackless-light")
* py.path: path abstractions over local and subversion files 
* rich documentation of py's exported API 
* tested against Win32, Linux and OSX 

All these features and their API have extensive documentation,
generated with the new "apigen", which we intend to make accessible
for other python projects as well.  

Here is the entry point for installing the py lib:

and here is the main entry point into the documentation:

The work on the py lib has been partially funded by the 
European Union and merlinux within the PyPy project. 

best, have fun and let us know what you think!
