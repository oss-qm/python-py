The py lib API 
==============

This is a placeholder for upcoming API documentation.  We
intend to mostly generate this API description from the py
lib's entry points, their docstrings and cross-reference it
with its tests and examples that are already available 
at our little `getting started`_ chapter. 

Your tests are your API insurance
=================================

Tests are the primary assurance of API compatilibity.  If you
would like to ensure some behaviour gets preserved across major
releases you have to write a test. Note though, that the 
documentation may state additional restrictions which
take precedence.
