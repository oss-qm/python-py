=======================
Source viewer for pylib
=======================

Purpose:
--------

As usual, main driving force to develop sth new is lack of several
possibilities between existing solutions. Major lack of features are:

* Impossible to link to certain function like http://filename#function_name

* Impossible to properly link - most informations coming from AST

* We want this to nicely integrate with apigen - so crosslinking from
  one to another makes sense (also backwards - like info for a function)

Idea:
-----

Basic idea is to take module as a py.path object, compile it (using compiler
module), than try to get some information and eventually import it and
get even some more information. Importing is optional and can be not performed
at all, but::

 if 1:
    def f(x):
       pass
 if 0:
    def g(x):
       pass

could be only parsed well in case of importing stuff. There are also plans for
integrating more features ie. caching it by code and attaching a name to a code
generated by some magic functions.

Status:
-------

Right now there is ready `server`_ and along with an `API viewer`_. Next step
is to improve a look & feel of API viewer and to link one to another.
