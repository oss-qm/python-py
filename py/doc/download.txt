"easy_install py"
===================================================

With a working `setuptools installation`_ you can install from the command line::

    easy_install py 

to get the latest release of the py lib.  On non-Windows systems you will 
need a working C-compiler in order to successfully complete this step. 
The py lib and its tools are expected to work well on Linux, Windows 
and OSX, Python versions 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: if you are using Windows and have previous 
installations of the py lib on your system, please download 
and execute http://codespeak.net/svn/py/build/winpathclean.py
This will check that no previous files are getting in the way. 
(Unfortunately we don't know about a way to execute this 
code automatically during the above install). 

.. _`setuptools installation`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

Downloading a tar/zip archive and installing that
===================================================

Go to the project pages and download a tar or zip file:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py/

and unpack it to a directory, where you then type::

    python setup.py install

If you don't have a working C-compiler you can do::

    python setup.py install_lib

You will then not be able to use greenlets but otherwise
should be fine. 

Installing from subversion / develop mode
============================================

To follow development or help with fixing things
for the next release, checkout the complete code
and documentation source::

    svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/py/release/0.9.x py-0.9.x

You should then be able to issue::

    python setup.py develop 

and work with the local version.  

If this doesn't work for you then you can also 
source (linux) or execute (windows) some scripts
that set environment variables for using your checkout. 
You can execute: 

    python ~/path/to/checkout/py/env.py 

or on windows:  

    \\path\\to\\checkout\\py\\env.cmd

to get settings for PYTHONPATH and PATH.


py subversion directory structure
=================================

The directory release layout of the repository is
going to follow this scheme:: 

    http://codespeak.net/
        svn/py/dist         # latest stable (may or may not be a release) 
        svn/py/release      # release tags and branches
        svn/py/trunk        # head development / merge point
