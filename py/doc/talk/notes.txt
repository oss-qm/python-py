* Persistant storage layer for storing py.test output, sharing such stuff
  and presenting (Presenting mostly means combining tones of hacks here
  and there). We need to store test results, revisions and additional
  metadata like apigen output

* Having some kind of pdbplus, which will combine rlcompleter, apigen
  information and other various fixes.

* Improve distributed testing by:
  - sharing even more code with normal testing
  - using greenexecnet wherever possible (falling back to normal
    execnet)
  - make test redistribution somehow (in a clean way!)
  - C-c support
