* get konqueror to display indents in source code better? 
  (currently it doesn't look like more than a single space)

* source page headers should read: 

    py/apigen sources [rev XXX]

* function view: 

     def __init__(self, rawcode):
        docstring-in-grey-and-not-in-a-box

  and the "show/hide funcinfo" link could be underyling
  the full "def __init__(self, rawcode)" or be a link right after 
  (or maybe before) it. 

  goal: consume less vertical space and have the functions
  be "sticking" out (the show/hide info link IMO disrupts this
  and it's not visually clear it belongs to the function above it)

  DONE, but please review if you like it like this...
 
  XXX it's nice but can you keep the docstring visible when
  more information is displayed/toggled? 

* allow for flexibility regarding linking from 
  py/doc/*.txt documents to apigen with respect
  to where apigen/ docs are located. 

  LATER, as discussed
