* when listing the methods of a class: 
  special "__*__" methods should come last except for __init__ 
  which comes first 

* the page header should read:
  
    py.path.local API documentation [rev XYZ]

  instead of 

    api documentation for path.local 

* have the py/doc/ and apigen page layout have
  an api and source link in the menu bar 
  (e.g.: home doc api source contact getting-started issue)

* function view: 

     def __init__(self, rawcode):
        docstring-in-grey-and-not-in-a-box

  and the "show/hide funcinfo" link could be underyling
  the full "def __init__(self, rawcode)" or be a link right after 
  (or maybe before) it. 

  goal: consume less vertical space and have the functions
  be "sticking" out (the show/hide info link IMO disrupts this
  and it's not visually clear it belongs to the function above it)

* can it be avoided that py.execnet.Channel shows up as a
  primary object but still have it documented/linked from 
  remote_exec()'s "return value"? 

* class attributes are not "properties". can they get their
  section? 

* stacktraces: a lot are "duplicates" like:

    /home/hpk/py-trunk/py/test/rsession/hostmanage.py - line 37
    /home/hpk/py-trunk/py/test/rsession/hostmanage.py - line 37
    /home/hpk/py-trunk/py/test/rsession/hostmanage.py - line 37

  even though they may reference different stackframes, 
  i think we should by default strip out these duplicates,
  this would also reduce the generated html files, right? 

* allow for flexibility regarding linking from 
  py/doc/*.txt documents to apigen with respect
  to where apigen/ docs are located.
